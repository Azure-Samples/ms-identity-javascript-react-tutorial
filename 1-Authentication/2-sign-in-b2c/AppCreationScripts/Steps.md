## Overview

This sample demonstrates a React SPA that authenticates users against Azure AD B2C.

## Scenario

1. The client React SPA uses the Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) to obtain an ID Token from **Azure AD B2C**.
2. The **ID Token** proves that the user has successfully authenticated against **Azure AD B2C**.

- A user account in your **Azure AD B2C** tenant.

## Setup

### Step 1: Clone or download this repository

From your shell or command line:

```console
    git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/ms-identity-javascript-react-tutorial.git
```

or download and extract the repository .zip file.

> :warning: To avoid path length limitations on Windows, we recommend cloning into a directory near the root of your drive.

### Step 2: Install project dependencies

```console
    cd msal-react-spa
    npm install
```

### Register the sample application(s) with your Azure Active Directory tenant

:warning: This sample comes with a pre-registered application for demo purposes. If you would like to use your own **Azure AD B2C** tenant and application, follow the steps below to register and configure the application on **Azure portal**. Otherwise, continue with the steps for [Running the sample](#running-the-sample).

### Choose the Azure AD tenant where you want to create your applications

As a first step you'll need to:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. If your account is present in more than one Azure AD B2C tenant, select your profile at the top right corner in the menu on top of the page, and then **switch directory** to change your portal session to the desired Azure AD B2C tenant.

### Create User Flows and Custom Policies

Please refer to: [Tutorial: Create user flows in Azure Active Directory B2C](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory-b2c/tutorial-create-user-flows)

### Add External Identity Providers

Please refer to: [Tutorial: Add identity providers to your applications in Azure Active Directory B2C](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory-b2c/tutorial-add-identity-providers)

### Register the spa app (msal-react-spa)

1. Navigate to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and select the **Azure AD B2C** service.
1. Select the **App Registrations** blade on the left, then select **New registration**.
1. In the **Register an application page** that appears, enter your application's registration information:
   - In the **Name** section, enter a meaningful application name that will be displayed to users of the app, for example `msal-react-spa`.
   - Under **Supported account types**, select **Accounts in any identity provider or organizational directory (for authenticating users with user flows)**.
   - In the **Redirect URI (optional)** section, select **Single-page application** in the combo-box and enter the following redirect URI: `http://localhost:3000`.
1. Select **Register** to create the application.
1. In the app's registration screen, find and note the **Application (client) ID**. You use this value in your app's configuration file(s) later in your code.
1. Select **Save** to save your changes.

#### Configure the spa app (msal-react-spa) to use your app registration

Open the project in your IDE (like Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code) to configure the code.

> In the steps below, "ClientID" is the same as "Application ID" or "AppId".

1. Open the `App\src\authConfig.js` file.
1. Find the key `Enter_the_Application_Id_Here` and replace the existing value with the application ID (clientId) of `msal-react-spa` app copied from the Azure portal.
1. Find the key `Enter_the_Cloud_Instance_Id_HereEnter_the_Tenant_Info_Here` and replace the existing value with "https://login.microsoftonline.com/"+$tenantName.

## Running the sample

```console
    cd msal-react-spa
    npm start
```

## Explore the sample

> Explain how to explore the sample.
> Insert a screenshot of the client application.

> :information_source: Did the sample not work for you as expected? Then please reach out to us using the [GitHub Issues](../../../issues) page.

> :information_source: if you believe your issue is with the B2C service itself rather than with the sample, please file a support ticket with the B2C team by following the instructions [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-b2c/support-options).

## Deployment

### Deploying SPA to Azure Storage

There is one single-page application in this sample. To deploy it to **Azure Storage**, you'll need to:

- create an Azure Storage blob and obtain website coordinates
- build your project and upload it to Azure Storage blob
- update config files with website coordinates

> :information_source: If you would like to use **VS Code Azure Tools** extension for deployment, [watch the tutorial](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/developer/javascript/tutorial-vscode-static-website-node-01) offered by Microsoft Docs.

#### Build and upload (msal-react-spa) to an Azure Storage blob

Build your project to get a distributable files folder, where your built `html`, `css` and `javascript` files will be generated. Then follow the steps below:

> :warning: When uploading, make sure you upload the contents of your distributable files folder and **not** the entire folder itself.

> :information_source: If you don't have an account already, see: [How to create a storage account](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-account-create).

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. Locate your storage account and display the account overview.
1. Select **Static website** to display the configuration page for static websites.
1. Select **Enabled** to enable static website hosting for the storage account.
1. In the **Index document name** field, specify a default index page (For example: `index.html`).
1. The default **index page** is displayed when a user navigates to the root of your static website.
1. Select **Save**. The Azure portal now displays your static website endpoint. Make a note of the **Primary endpoint field**.
1. In the `msal-react-spa` project source code, update your configuration file with the **Primary endpoint field** as your new **Redirect URI** (you will register this URI later).
1. Next, select **Storage Explorer**.
1. Expand the **BLOB CONTAINERS** node, and then select the `$web` container.
1. Choose the **Upload** button to upload files.
1. If you intend for the browser to display the contents of file, make sure that the content type of that file is set to `text/html`.
1. In the pane that appears beside the **account overview page** of your storage account, select **Static Website**. The URL of your site appears in the **Primary endpoint field**. In the next section, you will register this URI.

##### Update the Azure AD B2C app registration for msal-react-spa

1. Navigate back to to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. In the left-hand navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service, and then select **App registrations**.
1. In the resulting screen, select `msal-react-spa`.
1. In the app's registration screen, select **Authentication** in the menu.
   - In the **Redirect URIs** section, update the reply URLs to match the site URL of your Azure deployment. For example:
      - `https://msal-react-spa.azurewebsites.net/`
