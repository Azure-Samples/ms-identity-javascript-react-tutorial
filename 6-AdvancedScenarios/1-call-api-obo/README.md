## Overview

This sample demonstrates a React single-page application (SPA) calling a Node.js web API (*DownstreamAPI*) protected by a **conditional access** policy via another web API (*MiddletierAPI*) using the [OAuth 2.0 on-behalf-of (OBO) flow](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-on-behalf-of-flow). The SPA project is secured using the [Microsoft Authentication Library for React](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js/tree/dev/lib/msal-react) (MSAL React), while the web APIs leverage the [passport-azure-ad](https://github.com/AzureAD/passport-azure-ad) package.

The downstream web API has a [conditional access](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/overview) policy that enables [multi-factor authentication](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/authentication/tutorial-enable-azure-mfa) (MFA). Thus, the [Access Token](https://aka.ms/access-tokens) for the downstream web API will only be issued by Azure AD if the signed-in user has performed **MFA**. However, since the downstream web API has no user interaction capability, the [claims challenge](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/msal-error-handling-js#conditional-access-and-claims-challenges) generated by the conditional access policy needs to be *propagated back* to the client app (SPA) via the middle-tier web API, which can then take the user back to Azure AD to get the **MFA** done.

## Scenario

1. The client app uses **MSAL React** to sign-in a user and obtain a **JWT** [Access Token](https://aka.ms/access-tokens) from **Azure AD** for the middle-tier web API.
1. The access token is used as a *bearer token* to authorize the user to call the **middle-tier web API** protected by the **Azure AD**.
1. The **middle-tier web API** uses the access token sent from the client app to **Azure AD** to receive a new access token using the OBO flow for the downstream web API. If the user hasn't satisfied the MFA, Azure AD generates a **claims challenge** and sends the challenge back to the **middle-tier web API**.
1. The **middle-tier web API** propagates the **claims challenge** back to client app, which then initiates an **interactive** token request to get the user to perform MFA.
1. Once the user successfully conducts MFA, a new access token for is provided to client app for the **middle-tier web API**.
1. Steps **2** and **3** are repeated, and this time the call to **downstream web API** succeeds.

| `MiddletierAPI/config.json`| Contains authentication parameters for the middle-tier API. |
| `DownstreamAPI/config.json`| Contains authentication parameters for the downstream API. |

## Prerequisites

- An **Azure AD** tenant with [Conditional Access](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/overview#license-requirements) available. For more information see: [How to get an Azure AD tenant](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-create-new-tenant)
- A user account in your **Azure AD** tenant. This sample will not work with a **personal Microsoft account**. Therefore, if you signed in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) with a personal account and have never created a user account in your directory before, you need to do that now.
- Make sure that the user account you want to use for this is [enabled for MFA]((https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/user-help/user-help-auth-app-add-work-school-account)).

## Setup

### Step 1: Clone or download this repository

From your shell or command line:

```console
    git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/ms-identity-javascript-tutorial.git
```

or download and extract the repository .zip file.

> :warning: To avoid path length limitations on Windows, we recommend cloning into a directory near the root of your drive.

### Step 2: Install project dependencies

Locate the project root folder in a command prompt. Then:

```console
    cd DownstreamAPI
    npm install
```

```console
    cd ..
    cd MiddletierAPI
    npm install
```

```console
    cd ..
    cd SPA
    npm install
```

## Registration

### Register the sample application(s) with your Azure Active Directory tenant

There are three projects in this sample. Each needs to be separately registered in your Azure AD tenant. To register these projects, you can:

- follow the steps below for manually register your apps
- or use PowerShell scripts that:
  - **automatically** creates the Azure AD applications and related objects (passwords, permissions, dependencies) for you.
  - modify the projects' configuration files.

<details>
  <summary>Expand this section if you want to use this automation:</summary>

> :warning: If you have never used **Azure AD Powershell** before, we recommend you go through the [App Creation Scripts](./AppCreationScripts/AppCreationScripts.md) once to ensure that your environment is prepared correctly for this step.

1. On Windows, run PowerShell as **Administrator** and navigate to the root of the cloned directory
1. If you have never used Azure AD Powershell before, we recommend you go through the [App Creation Scripts](./AppCreationScripts/AppCreationScripts.md) once to ensure that your environment is prepared correctly for this step.
1. In PowerShell run:

   ```PowerShell
   Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope Process -Force
   ```

1. Run the script to create your Azure AD application and configure the code of the sample application accordingly.
1. In PowerShell run:

   ```PowerShell
   cd .\AppCreationScripts\
   .\Configure.ps1
   ```

   > Other ways of running the scripts are described in [App Creation Scripts](./AppCreationScripts/AppCreationScripts.md)
   > The scripts also provide a guide to automated application registration, configuration and removal which can help in your CI/CD scenarios.

</details>

### Choose the Azure AD tenant where you want to create your applications

As a first step you'll need to:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. If your account is present in more than one Azure AD tenant, select your profile at the top right corner in the menu on top of the page, and then **switch directory** to change your portal session to the desired Azure AD tenant.

### Register the downstream web API (msal-react-downstream)

1. Navigate to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and select the **Azure AD** service.
1. Select the **App Registrations** blade on the left, then select **New registration**.
1. In the **Register an application page** that appears, enter your application's registration information:
   - In the **Name** section, enter a meaningful application name that will be displayed to users of the app, for example `msal-react-downstream`.
   - Under **Supported account types**, select **Accounts in this organizational directory only**.
1. Select **Register** to create the application.
1. In the app's registration screen, find and note the **Application (client) ID**. You use this value in your app's configuration file(s) later in your code.
1. Select **Save** to save your changes.
1. In the app's registration screen, select the **Expose an API** blade to the left to open the page where you can declare the parameters to expose this app as an API for which client applications can obtain [access tokens](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/access-tokens) for.
The first thing that we need to do is to declare the unique [resource](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-auth-code-flow) URI that the clients will be using to obtain access tokens for this API. To declare an resource URI, follow the following steps:
   - Select `Set` next to the **Application ID URI** to generate a URI that is unique for this app.
   - For this sample, accept the proposed Application ID URI (`api://{clientId}`) by selecting **Save**.
1. All APIs have to publish a minimum of one [scope](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-auth-code-flow#request-an-authorization-code) for the client's to obtain an access token successfully. To publish a scope, follow the following steps:
   - Select **Add a scope** button open the **Add a scope** screen and Enter the values as indicated below:
        - For **Scope name**, use `access_downstream_api_as_user`.
        - Select **Admins and users** options for **Who can consent?**.
        - For **Admin consent display name** type `Access msal-react-downstream`.
        - For **Admin consent description** type `Allows the app to access msal-react-downstream as the signed-in user.`
        - For **User consent display name** type `Access msal-react-downstream`.
        - For **User consent description** type `Allow the application to access msal-react-downstream on your behalf.`
        - Keep **State** as **Enabled**.
        - Select the **Add scope** button on the bottom to save this scope.
1. On the right side menu, select the `Manifest` blade.
   - Set `accessTokenAcceptedVersion` property to **2**.
   - Click on **Save**.

#### Configure the downstream web API (msal-react-downstream) to use your app registration

Open the project in your IDE (like Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code) to configure the code.

> In the steps below, "ClientID" is the same as "Application ID" or "AppId".

1. Open the `DownstreamAPI\config.json` file.
1. Find the key `clientID` and replace the existing value with the application ID (clientId) of `msal-react-downstream` app copied from the Azure portal.

   - Type a key description (for instance `app secret`),
   - Select one of the available key durations (**In 1 year**, **In 2 years**, or **Never Expires**) as per your security posture.
   - The generated key value will be displayed when you select the **Add** button. Copy the generated value for use in the steps later.
   - You'll need this key later in your code's configuration files. This key value will not be displayed again, and is not retrievable by any other means, so make sure to note it from the Azure portal before navigating to any other screen or blade.
1. In the app's registration screen, select the **API permissions** blade in the left to open the page where we add access to the APIs that your application needs.

## About the code

### Handling conditional access claims challenge

If the conditional access policy is not satisfied when calling the downstream web API, Azure AD will throw an error together with a claims challenge. In our middle-tier web API, we are to catch this and send it to the client SPA. This is illustrated in the middle-tier web API [index.js](./MiddletierAPI/index.js) file:

```javascript
   try {
      // request new token and use it to call resource API on user's behalf
      tokenObj = await getNewAccessToken(userToken);

      // check for errors
      if (tokenObj['error_codes']) {
            
            /**
             * Conditional access MFA requirement throws an AADSTS50076 error.
             * If the user has not enrolled in MFA, an AADSTS50079 error will be thrown instead.
             * If the user has not consented to required scopes, an AADSTS65001 error will be thrown instead.
             * In either case, sample middle-tier API will propagate the error back to the client.
             * For more, visit: https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-conditional-access-dev-guide
             */
            if (tokenObj['error_codes'].includes(50076) || tokenObj['error_codes'].includes(50079) || tokenObj['error_codes'].includes(65001)) {
               return res.status(403).json(tokenObj);
            }
      }

      try {
            // access the resource with the token
            let apiResponse = await callResourceAPI(tokenObj['access_token'], config.resources.downstreamAPI.resourceUri);
            return res.status(200).json(apiResponse);
      } catch (error) {
            console.log(error);
            return res.status(403).json(error);
      }
      
   } catch (error) {
      console.log(error);
      return res.status(403).json(error);
   }
```

Then, in the SPA project, we catch this error response and initiate an interactive token request with additional claims. To do so, we append the JSON object from the response to our [tokenRequest](./SPA/src/authConfig.js) object before triggering the interactive token request. This is illustrated in [api.js](./SPA/src/fetch.js):

```javascript
   
```

In the component:

```javascript
   
```
