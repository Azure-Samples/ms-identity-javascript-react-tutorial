## Overview

This sample demonstrates how to deploy a React single-page application (SPA) coupled with a Node.js web API to **Azure Cloud** using [Azure Storage](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/blobs/) and [Azure App Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/), respectively.

Azure Storage provides a low cost static website hosting alternative. However, these static websites do not have advanced routing capabilities. As such, [the React SPA in this tutorial](./SPA) does not have a router component.

For React applications with routing support, you can use [Azure Static Web Apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/static-web-apps/) instead. See [Static Web App Deployment](../2-deploy-static/README.md) in the next section.

## Scenario

1. The client application uses **MSAL React** to sign-in a user and obtain a JWT **Access Token** from **Azure AD**.
1. The **Access Token** is used as a **bearer** token to *authorize* the user to call the protected web API.
1. The protected web API responds with the claims in the **Access Token**.

## Prerequisites

- [VS Code Azure Tools Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-node-azure-pack) extension is recommended for interacting with **Azure** through VS Code interface.
- An **Azure subscription**. This sample uses **Azure Storage** and **Azure App Service**.

## Setup

### Step 1: Clone or download this repository

From your shell or command line:

```console
    git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/ms-identity-javascript-react-tutorial.git
```

or download and extract the repository .zip file.

> :warning: To avoid path length limitations on Windows, we recommend cloning into a directory near the root of your drive.

### Step 2: Install project dependencies

- Setup the service app:

```console
    cd ms-identity-javascript-react-tutorial
    cd 4-Deployment/1-deploy-storage
    cd API
    npm install
```

- Setup the client app:

```console
    cd ..
    cd SPA
    npm install
```

## Registration

### Register the service app (Node.js web API)

Use the same app registration credentials that you've obtained during [**chapter 3-1**](../../3-Authorization-II/1-call-api/README.md#registration). Update your project files here as needed.

### Register the client app (React SPA)

Use the same app registration credentials that you've obtained during [**chapter 3-1**](../../3-Authorization-II/1-call-api/README.md#registration). Update your project files here as needed.

## Deployment

There are basically **3** stages that you will have to go through in order to deploy your projects and enable authentication:

1. Upload your project files to **Azure** services and obtain published website URIs
1. Update **Azure AD** **App Registration** with URIs you have just obtained
1. Update your configuration files with URIs you have just obtained

### Deploy the service app (Node.js web API)

There are various ways to deploy your applications to **Azure App Service**. Here we provide steps for deployment via **VS Code Azure Tools Extension**. For more alternatives, visit: [Static website hosting in Azure Storage](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blob-static-website#uploading-content).

> We recommend watching the [video tutorial](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/developer/javascript/tutorial-vscode-azure-app-service-node-01) offered by Microsoft Docs for preparation.

#### Step 1: Deploy your app

1. In the **VS Code** activity bar, select the **Azure** logo to show the **AZURE APP SERVICE** explorer. Select **Sign in to Azure...** and follow the instructions. Once signed in, the explorer should show the name of your **Azure** subscription(s).

![api_step1](./ReadmeFiles/api_step1.png)

1. On the **App Service** explorer section you will see an upward-facing arrow icon. Click on it publish your local files in the `API` folder to **Azure App Services**.

![api_step2](./ReadmeFiles/api_step2.png)

1. Choose a creation option based on the operating system to which you want to deploy. in this sample, we choose **Linux**.
1. Select a Node.js version when prompted. An **LTS** version is recommended.
1. Type a globally unique name for your web app and press Enter. The name must be unique across all of **Azure**.
1. After you respond to all the prompts, **VS Code** shows the **Azure** resources that are being created for your app in its notification popup.
1. Select **Yes** when prompted to update your configuration to run npm install on the target Linux server.

![api_step3](./ReadmeFiles/api_step3.png)

#### Step 2: Disable default authentication

Now you need to navigate to the **Azure App Service** Portal, and locate your project there. Once you do, click on the **Authentication/Authorization** blade. There, make sure that the **App Services Authentication** is switched off (and nothing else is checked), as we are using **our own** authentication logic.

### Deploy the client app (React SPA)

There are various ways to deploy your applications to **Azure Storage**. Here we provide steps for deployment via **VS Code Azure Tools Extension**. For more alternatives, visit: [Static website hosting in Azure Storage](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blob-static-website#uploading-content).

> We recommend watching the [video tutorial](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/developer/javascript/tutorial-vscode-static-website-node-01) offered by Microsoft Docs for preparation.

#### Step 1: Deploy the app

1. Create a distributable files folder, where your `html`, `css` and `javascript` files will be located. To do so, locate the `SPA` folder in your terminal, then type:

```console
    npm run build
```

This will create a `build` folder. We will upload the contents of this folder next.

1. Right click on the `SPA/build` folder. This will open a context menu where you will see the option **Deploy to static website via Azure Storage**. Click on it.

![spa_step1](./ReadmeFiles/spa_step1.png)

2. Follow the dialog window that opens on the top. Select your subscription, then give a name to your storage account.

![spa_step2](./ReadmeFiles/spa_step2.png)

3. Once your storage account is created and your files are uploaded, you will see a notification on the bottom-right corner of VS Code interface. When it's done, you will be notified with the published URI of your static website (e.g. `https://reactspa1.z22.web.core.windows.net/`).

![spa_step3](./ReadmeFiles/spa_step3.png)

#### Step 2: Update the client app's authentication parameters

1. Navigate back to to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. In the left-hand navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service, and then select **App registrations**.
1. In the resulting screen, select the name of your application.
1. From the *Branding* menu, update the **Home page URL**, to the address of your service, for example [https://reactspa1.z22.web.core.windows.net/](https://reactspa1.z22.web.core.windows.net/). Save the configuration.
1. Add the same URI in the list of values of the *Authentication -> Redirect URIs* menu. If you have multiple redirect URIs, make sure that there a new entry using the App service's URI for each redirect URI.

#### Step 3: Update the client app's configuration files

Now you need to update your authentication configuration files in the client project. To do so, go to your **Azure Storage Account** explorer via **VS Code** Azure panel. There, click on your project's name > **Blob Container** > **Web** as shown below:

![spa_step4](./ReadmeFiles/spa_step4.png)

Open `authConfig.js`. Then:

1. Find the key `protectedResources.apiHello.endpoint` and replace the existing value with your published web API's endpoint, e.g. `https://node-webapi-1.azurewebsites.net/hello`

#### Step 4: Enable cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) for service app

Finally, we need to enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing by designating the domain of the SPA we've just deployed. Navigate to App Service portal and locate your web API. Then, enable CORS by entering your website's URI as shown below:

![enable_cors](./ReadmeFiles/enable_cors.png)

## Explore the sample

1. Open your browser and navigate to your deployed client app's URI, for instance: `https://reactspa1.z22.web.core.windows.net/`.
1. Select the **Sign In** button on the top right corner. Choose either **Popup** or **Redirect** flow.
1. Select the **Request Profile Data** button in the home screen. This will make a call to your web API.
