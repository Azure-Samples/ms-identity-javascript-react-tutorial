## Overview

This sample demonstrates a React single-page application (SPA) calling a protected Node.js web API using the [Microsoft Authentication Library for React](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js/tree/dev/lib/msal-react) (MSAL React). The Node.js web API itself is protected using the [passport-azure-ad](https://github.com/AzureAD/passport-azure-ad) plug-in for [Passport.js](http://www.passportjs.org/)

Here you'll learn how to [register a protected web API](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/scenario-protected-web-api-app-registration), [accept authorized calls](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/scenario-protected-web-api-verification-scope-app-roles) and [validate access tokens](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/access-tokens#validating-tokens).

## Scenario

1. The client React SPA uses **MSAL React** to sign-in and obtain a JWT access token from **Azure AD B2C**.
1. The access token is used as a bearer token to authorize the user to call the Node.js web API protected **Azure AD B2C**.
1. The protected web API responds with the signed-in user's todolist.

## Setup the sample

### Step 1: Clone or download this repository

From your shell or command line:

```console
git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/ms-identity-javascript-react-tutorial.git
```

or download and extract the repository *.zip* file.

> :warning: To avoid path length limitations on Windows, we recommend cloning into a directory near the root of your drive.

### Step 2: Navigate to project folder

Install the dependencies for the service app:

```console
    cd ms-identity-javascript-react-tutorial
    cd 3-Authorization-II/2-call-api-b2c/API
    npm install
```

Next, install the dependencies for the client app:

```console
    cd ..
    cd SPA
    npm install
```

### Step 3: Register the sample application(s) in your tenant

> :warning: This sample comes with a pre-registered application for demo purposes. If you would like to use your own **Azure AD B2C** tenant and application, follow the steps below to register and configure the application on **Azure portal**. Otherwise, continue with the steps.

#### Choose the Azure AD B2C tenant where you want to create your applications

as a first step you'll need to:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
2. If your account is present in more than one Azure AD B2C tenant, select your profile at the top right corner in the menu on top of the page, and then **switch directory** to change your portal session to the desired Azure AD B2C tenant.

#### Create User Flows and Custom Policies

Please refer to: [Tutorial: Create user flows in Azure Active Directory B2C](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory-b2c/tutorial-create-user-flows)

#### Add External Identity Providers

Please refer to: [Tutorial: Add identity providers to your applications in Azure Active Directory B2C](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory-b2c/tutorial-add-identity-providers)

#### Register the service app (ms-identity-react-c3s2-api)

1. Navigate to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and select the **Azure Active Directory B2C** service.
1. Select the **App Registrations** blade on the left, then select **New registration**.
1. In the **Register an application page** that appears, enter your application's registration information:
    1. In the **Name** section, enter a meaningful application name that will be displayed to users of the app, for example `ms-identity-react-c3s2-api`.
    1. Under **Supported account types**, select **Accounts in any identity provider or organizational directory (for authenticating users with user flows)**
    1. Select **Register** to create the application.
1. In the **Overview** blade, find and note the **Application (client) ID**. You use this value in your app's configuration file(s) later in your code.
1. In the app's registration screen, select the **Expose an API** blade to the left to open the page where you can publish the permission as an API for which client applications can obtain [access tokens](https://aka.ms/access-tokens) for. The first thing that we need to do is to declare the unique [resource](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-auth-code-flow) URI that the clients will be using to obtain access tokens for this API. To declare an resource URI(Application ID URI), follow the following steps:
    1. Select **Set** next to the **Application ID URI** to generate a URI that is unique for this app.
    1. For this sample, accept the proposed Application ID URI (`https://{tenantName}.onmicrosoft.com/{clientId}`) by selecting **Save**. Read more about Application ID URI at [Validation differences by supported account types \(signInAudience\)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/supported-accounts-validation).

##### Publish Delegated Permissions

1. All APIs must publish a minimum of one [scope](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-auth-code-flow#request-an-authorization-code), also called [Delegated Permission](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-permissions-and-consent#permission-types), for the client apps to obtain an access token for a *user* successfully. To publish a scope, follow these steps:
1. Select **Add a scope** button open the **Add a scope** screen and Enter the values as indicated below:
    1. For **Scope name**, use `Todolist.Read`.
    1. For **Admin consent display name** type in *Todolist.Read*.
    1. For **Admin consent description** type in *e.g. Allows the app to read the signed-in user's files.*.
    1. Keep **State** as **Enabled**.
    1. Select the **Add scope** button on the bottom to save this scope.

    > Repeat the steps above for another scope named **Todolist.ReadWrite**
1. Select the **Manifest** blade on the left.
    1. Set `accessTokenAcceptedVersion` property to **2**.
    1. Select on **Save**.

> :information_source:  Follow [the principle of least privilege when publishing permissions](https://learn.microsoft.com/security/zero-trust/develop/protected-api-example) for a web API.

##### Configure the service app (ms-identity-react-c3s2-api) to use your app registration

Open the project in your IDE (like Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code) to configure the code.

> In the steps below, "ClientID" is the same as "Application ID" or "AppId".

1. Open the `API\authConfig.js` file.
1. Find the key `clientID` and replace the existing value with the application ID (clientId) of `ms-identity-react-c3s2-api` app copied from the Azure portal.
1. Find the key `tenantName` and replace the existing value with your Azure AD B2C tenant's name (e.g. `fabrikamb2c.onmicrosoft.com`).

#### Register the client app (ms-identity-react-c3s2-spa)

1. Navigate to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and select the **Azure Active Directory B2C** service.
1. Select the **App Registrations** blade on the left, then select **New registration**.
1. In the **Register an application page** that appears, enter your application's registration information:
    1. In the **Name** section, enter a meaningful application name that will be displayed to users of the app, for example `ms-identity-react-c3s2-spa`.
    1. Under **Supported account types**, select **Accounts in any identity provider or organizational directory (for authenticating users with user flows)**
    1. Select **Register** to create the application.
1. In the **Overview** blade, find and note the **Application (client) ID**. You use this value in your app's configuration file(s) later in your code.
1. In the app's registration screen, select the **Authentication** blade to the left.
1. If you don't have a platform added, select **Add a platform** and select the **Single-page application** option.
    1. In the **Redirect URI** section enter the following redirect URIs:
        1. `http://localhost:3000`
    1. Click **Save** to save your changes.
1. Since this app signs-in users, we will now proceed to select **delegated permissions**, which is is required by apps signing-in users.
    1. In the app's registration screen, select the **API permissions** blade in the left to open the page where we add access to the APIs that your application needs:
    1. Select the **Add a permission** button and then:
    1. Ensure that the **My APIs** tab is selected.
    1. In the list of APIs, select the API `ms-identity-react-c3s2-api`.
      * Since this app signs-in users, we will now proceed to select **delegated permissions**, which is requested by apps that signs-in users.
      * In the **Delegated permissions** section, select **Todolist.Read**, **Todolist.ReadWrite** in the list. Use the search box if necessary.
    1. Select the **Add permissions** button at the bottom.

##### Configure the client app (ms-identity-react-c3s2-spa) to use your app registration

Open the project in your IDE (like Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code) to configure the code.

> In the steps below, "ClientID" is the same as "Application ID" or "AppId".

1. Open the `SPA\src\authConfig.js` file.
1. Find the key `msalConfig.auth.clientId` and replace the existing value with the application ID (clientId) of `ms-identity-react-c3s2-spa` app copied from the Azure portal.
1. Find the key `protectedResources.apiTodoList.scopes` and replace the existing value with the Scopes.

To setup your B2C user-flows, do the following:

1. Find the key `b2cPolicies.names` and populate it with your policy names e.g. `signUpSignIn`.
1. Find the key `b2cPolicies.authorities` and populate it with your policy authority strings e.g. `https://<your-tenant-name>.b2clogin.com/<your-tenant-name>.onmicrosoft.com/b2c_1_susi`.
1. Find the key `b2cPolicies.authorityDomain` and populate it with the domain portion of your authority string e.g. `<your-tenant-name>.b2clogin.com`.

### Step 4: Running the sample

From your shell or command line, execute the following commands:

```console
    cd 3-Authorization-II/2-call-api-b2c/API
    npm start
```

```console
     cd 3-Authorization-II/2-call-api-b2c/SPA
    npm start
```

## Explore the sample

1. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.
1. Select the **Sign In** button on the top right corner. Choose either **Popup** or **Redirect** flows.
1. Select the **Todolist** button on the navigation bar. This will make a call to the Todolist web API.

## About the code

### Access token validation

On the web API side, [passport-azure-ad](https://github.com/AzureAD/passport-azure-ad) verifies the incoming access token's signature and validates it's payload against the `issuer` and `audience` claims (defined in `BearerStrategy` constructor) using the `passport.authenticate()` API. In the `BearerStrategy` callback, you can add further validation steps as shown below (see [app.js](./API/app.js)):

```javascript
    const options = {
    identityMetadata: `https://${authConfig.metadata.b2cDomain}/${authConfig.credentials.tenantName}/${authConfig.policies.policyName}/${authConfig.metadata.version}/${authConfig.metadata.discovery}`,
    clientID: authConfig.credentials.clientID,
    audience: authConfig.credentials.clientID,
    policyName: authConfig.policies.policyName,
    isB2C: authConfig.settings.isB2C,
    validateIssuer: authConfig.settings.validateIssuer,
    loggingLevel: authConfig.settings.loggingLevel,
    passReqToCallback: authConfig.settings.passReqToCallback,
};

const bearerStrategy = new passportAzureAd.BearerStrategy(options, (token, done) => {
    /**
     * Below you can do extended token validation and check for additional claims, such as:
     * - check if the caller's tenant is in the allowed tenants list via the 'tid' claim (for multi-tenant applications)
     * - check if the delegated permissions in the 'scp' are the same as the ones declared in the application registration.
     *
     * Bear in mind that you can do any of the above checks within the individual routes and/or controllers as well.
     * For more information, visit: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-b2c/tokens-overview
     */

    /**
     * Lines below verifies if the caller's client ID is in the list of allowed clients.
     * This ensures only the applications with the right client ID can access this API.
     * To do so, we use "azp" claim in the access token. Uncomment the lines below to enable this check.
     */

    // const myAllowedClientsList = [
    //     /* add here the client IDs of the applications that are allowed to call this API */
    // ]

    // if (!myAllowedClientsList.includes(token.azp)) {
    //     return done(new Error('Unauthorized'), {}, "Client not allowed");
    // }

    // const myAllowedClientsList = [
    //     /* add here the client IDs of the applications that are allowed to call this API */
    // ]

    /**
     * Access tokens that have no 'scp' (for delegated permissions).
     */
    if (!token.hasOwnProperty('scp')) {
        return done(new Error('Unauthorized'), null, 'No delegated permissions found');
    }

    done(null, {}, token);
});


app.use(passport.initialize());

passport.use(bearerStrategy);
```

Clients should treat access tokens as opaque strings, as the contents of the token are intended for the resource only (such as a web API or Microsoft Graph). For validation and debugging purposes, developers can decode **JWT**s (*JSON Web Tokens*) using a site like [jwt.ms](https://jwt.ms).

### CORS Settings

For the purpose of the sample, **cross-origin resource sharing** is enabled for **all** domains. This is insecure. In production, you should modify this as to allow only the domains that you designate.

```javascript
    app.use(cors());
```
